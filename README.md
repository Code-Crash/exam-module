* To start the ```web-server``` we need to follow the below steps.

```
$cd web-server/

$npm install

$npm start
```
* If you face any issues with ```npm start```, then check if you have installed ```@angular/cli``` or not, you can install by using the command as follow:

```
$npm install @angular/cli -g
```
* If ```npm install``` is running for a long time, use control+c and then see if there is any error or not, and also try running ```npm start``` if it works.
* If everything is fine, you will see the web-server is running on ```http://localhost:4200/```.
